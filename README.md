# Speech-to-Speech Translation Project

This project allows users to upload a video, where the speech is automatically transcribed, translated, and converted back into speech in the desired language. The backend is ready to process the video for real-time translation, and the user interface is built using Flask to handle file uploads and provide the translated version for download.

## Key Features:
- Upload videos for speech translation.
- Translate spoken content in videos to another language.
- Download the translated video with the new speech.

## Technology Stack:
- Python
- Flask
- Speech-to-Text
- Text-to-Speech
